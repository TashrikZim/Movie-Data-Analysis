Movie Data Analysis in R
This project explores the IMDB Movie Metadata dataset using R. The workflow covers data cleaning, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and different types of visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, regression models).

The goal was to understand patterns in movie budgets, revenues, IMDb ratings, and genre distributions, while also practicing R programming skills such as using dplyr, ggplot2, and corrplot.

Key highlights:

> Cleaned and pre-processed raw movie dataset (handled missing values, duplicates).

> Performed descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, IQR, etc.).

>  Visualized IMDb score distribution, budget trends, and revenue patterns.

> Built regression models to study relationships (e.g., budget vs gross revenue).

> Generated a correlation heatmap to explore variable dependencies.
